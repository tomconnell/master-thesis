\chapter{ABC}

This chapter will outline a series of illustrative ABC examples. These will serve to demonstrate core concepts touched on in the introduction, demonstrate ABC can sample from complex distributions, and develop the boutique code base which form the foundations of this project. The code for the examples in this section can be found at \url{https://github.com/tomconnell/dram}.
