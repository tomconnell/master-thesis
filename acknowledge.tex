\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to acknowledge the love and support of Melanie. Without it this work would not have been possible.\\ 

I would also like to thank the continuous encouragement from my parents Sean and Heather, who always pushed me to do what I wanted. Without such freedom I may never have ended up on the path I am now.
