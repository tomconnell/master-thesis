Macquarie University thesis LaTeX class file. 
====================================================================

This is a LaTeX class file (and associated style files provided with
the package but falling under different copyright agreements) that
can be used in the preparation of MRes and PhD theses at 
Macquarie University, Sydney.

The files are distributed as a simple .zip file.  Uncompress with
your favorite decompression utitlity, and you will be presented with
a "mqthesisv2" directory.

Within this directory you will find,

 o thesis.tex: the main TeX file 
 o abstract.tex, acknowledge.tex, listofpublications.tex, 
   listofsymbols.tex: frontmatter files
 o chap_intro.tex, chap_other.tex, chap_conclusion.tex, 
   chap_appendix.tex: sample chapter files
 o references.bib: sample BibTeX file

Edit and add to these as you see fit, don't forget to include extra files in
thesis.tex.

mqthesis.cls is the main class file that defines the look, and mqthesis.bst
defines the style of the bibliography (generated using the makebst), edit these
to tweak the look. 

mqthesis depends on a number of standard packages, look through mqthesis.cls to see 
what is used and any notes. Modify as you see fit.

Good luck. Don't Panic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is aimed to be a modification of Alexei Gilchrist's thesis template based on personal preferences, making it more amenable to thesis-by-publication and easy for non-latex users to implement. User guide is in development. NOTE: This does not have explicit official approval. The version that has official approval is Alexei's which is avaliable from www.entropy.energy or the first release of this repository (https://github.com/stuartmead/mqthesis/releases/tag/2.0).

Now with continuous integration so you don't have to worry about builds and have a backup! See the wiki for details on how to set it up for your own repo.
